> It is based on labelled data so it is a supervised learning model where we uses regression technique to predict the estimated value of the houses with minimum errors.

| Data          | Type          | Model         |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Labelled      | `Supervised`  |classification |


> It uses many types of classification techinque like logistic regression,k Nearest Kneighbor,Decision tree,random forest out of which we come to conclusion that *KNN*
(k Nearest Kneighbor) is suited best for this model with minimum errors.

**Steps to choose model for our data**

1 data colletion
2 data visualization
3 preprocessing
4 model evaluation (given below)
**steps**

* Is our data  labelled ? i.e, if labelled then it is supervise else unsupervised.
* What to do ?(i.e, do we have to preform prediction or classificatio or regression or time series).
* model selection (for this we have to apply different types of models and check which is suited best for our model).
